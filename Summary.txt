Summary

- Overall, the data has examined 39,170 students across 15 schools. The average maths score was 70.34%, with the average reading score slightly lower at 69.98%.

- 86% and 64% of the cohort passed their maths and reading exams respectively. 
  This passing range varied from school to school - the lowest math score belonging to Hernandez High School (80.95%) 
  and highest belonging to Wright High School (91.78%).


- There is no strong increasing/declining trend in average maths and reading scores as students progress from Year 9 to 12, 
  with a variance of 2-3 percentage points per school observed 

- Surprisingly, as the spend per student increased across our schools, the average maths and reading scores both display a decreasing trend. 
  For example, spending in the range of <$585 resulted in an average Maths Score of 71.37%. Contrasting this, the max spendng range of $645-680 
  per student results in a 68.88% average Maths Score.

- Smaller schools (less than 1000 students) achieved higher average scores and higher percentage pass marks across both maths and reading, 
  followed by medium (1000-2000) and large (2000-5000).

- Independent schools attracted higher average scores & % passing rates when compared to their Government school counterparts. For example, the passing
  rate for maths in independent schools was 88.7%, whereas Government schools scored a 84.9% pass rate. 


Conclusion
The ideal environment for high test scores & passing rates are observed in small, independent schools with a comparatively low spend per student.
